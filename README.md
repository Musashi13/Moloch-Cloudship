## What Is Moloch Cloudship

Ok, picture this:

We build a spaceship in Neos. As we walk through the halls we see doors with signs above them. One is MetaGame. One is MetaCartel. One is Token Engineering Commons. You enter one and are presented with a built out space (built by their community or directed by and sponsored by their community). You see a door labeled ‚ÄúDAO‚Äù, a door labeled ‚ÄúHangout‚Äù, a door labeled ‚ÄúWorkspace‚Äù, a door labeled ‚ÄúPlayers‚Äù (or whatever is a VIP to their community. Players for MG.). As you work within your own space, you can walk down the hall to TEC and work on tokenomics in their workspace, walk down the hall to hire Raid Guild, down the hall to vote in someone else DAO or at the DAO Dome that has all the DAOs represented on the ship.
So, basically everyone is floating on this ship building out our cloud cities from within the ship. We shift all things we do on discord and github and notion into this ship. As we build out our cloud cities we are orbiting Earth to establish our cloud cities when we are prepared. One by one the ship should empty, as we all build out IRL cities all over earth. So, the ship can represent Moloch. And we can actually build out ghostly demons showing up around the ship that hold info about a problem that needs solving from amongst one or all of these DAOs.
The demons can be ‚Äúcast out‚Äù if the raid is taken on and succeeds. Then demon is slain.
In MetaGame we are currently looking to gamify our work as well.
This allows us to silo everything we do in discord, notion, discourse, snapshot, github, etc all in one platform.
While also allowing for many different ways to gamify each aspect we want.

Every DAO owns and wholly runs their own space. To be apart of the ship, simply making a portal to the Moloch Commons Hub will connect you to the ship. Our team will work with you to place yyou within the Cloudship Blueprints and listed in the Commons.
